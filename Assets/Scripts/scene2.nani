They encountered the poker soldiers who was singing while burning books, an order issued by the Queen of Hearts
@char Alice  pos:15,-6 scale:0.8,0.8,0.8 look:Right
Alice: Emmmâ€¦What are they doing now?
Just as they sing in their song, the Queen of Hearts is all-knowing and all-powerful, so there is absolutely no wonder in this world that she cannot resolve. In order to smoothly implement her authoritarian policies, the Queen does not allow any doubts to exist among the people. 
Therefore, she decides to eliminate all wonders, starting with the elimination of detective and mystery novels. Even the painstakingly crafted Situation puzzle that I wrote has been burned.
Alice: What? Why?
Alice: ...(thinking) Even though the Queen of Hearts and I both often talk about 'eliminating wonders,' our approaches are diametrically opposed. I face problems and seek solutions bravely, while the Queen of Hearts, in order to maintain her position, resorts to stifling problems rather than solving them.
